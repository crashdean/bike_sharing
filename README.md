## Bikesharing NYC CitiBike data

[NYC CitiBike Share story.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.dean.larsson/viz/Book2_16683985234930/NYCCitiBikeAnalysisChallenge?publish=yes)


### Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a proposal ,using Storyboards and Dahboards from Tableau, to impress inverstors for starting a 
bike share program in Des Moines, Iowa.   There is a graet deal of data from Kates trip to New York city when she used their bike share
program CitiBike.  The data that will be using in the proposal has many key area including:

*  Trip Duation(Seconds)
*  Start Times and Date
*  Stop Times and Date
*  Start Station
*  End Station
*  Station ID
*  Station Lat/Long
*  Bike ID
*  User Type
*  Gender
*  Year of Birth

### Results

Des Moines Iowa has a different demographic for both population and accessability of bike riders. than New York.   Given the success 
of the CitiBike share program in New York, it provides great insight from the available data set using Tableau as a presentation tool.

#### NYC Citi Bike Dashboard

Here is a Dashboard of the CitiBike share.   The Average Trip Duration has increased with the increase of Birth Year.   The total number
of riders for the data set show over 2 million.   This would indicate a strong use in New York city.  The bottom dots on the map show
start locations for ride share.   The larger the circle, and the darker the blue color, the higher ride share staion use.


#### Top Start Locations

This image shows one station with high usage.   This is were the most bikes would be needed.

This image shows one station with low usage.   This is where less bike would be needed.

#### Top Ending Locations

Here we can see that most rides end close to were they start. 

#### August Peak Hours

During the month of August, the peak hours of use for the bikes is 7 - 9 am and 4 - 6 pm.   This is important to understand for having the most
bikes available for use.

#### Bike Utilization

This image shows the the use of all bikes with there ID numbers.   This visual is important to gather a full specrum picture of the number of bikes
with comparable high and low use.   Along with other images, the need to move higher use bikes out of an area and switch will lower use bikes would 
prolong the life span of all bikes.

#### Bike Repairs

This image shows the distribution of bikes according to their total usage.   For the purpose of bike maintenance, this visulization shows smaller lighter
squares for bike with less use.   To schedule repairs and maintenance, this image along with peak hours image, allows for scheduling of maintenance.

#### Trips per Weekend per Gender

### Summary

  In summary, the Citibie share program seems to offer
