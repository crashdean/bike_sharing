Here is a Dashboard of the CitiBike share.   The Average Trip Duration has increased with the increase of Birth Year.   The total number
of riders for the data set show over 2 million.   This would indicate a strong use in New York city.  The bottom dots on the map show
start locations for ride share.   The larger the circle, and the darker the blue color, the higher ride share staion use.
